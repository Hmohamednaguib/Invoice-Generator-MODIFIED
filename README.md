# Invoice-Generator-MODIFIED
This is the modified invoice generator
I have fixed the total price error. The save button and cancel button is working also fine... The last change where it says that user can add item anytime not just in the create invoice time, is not part of the requirnments... also there is no GUI components specified for adding new items(no button) and i cannot go beyond the Gui which was given in the requirnement
